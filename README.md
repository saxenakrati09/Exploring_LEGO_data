# Exploring_LEGO_data
Exploration of a database of every LEGO set ever built.

The Rebrickable database (can be found on https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, the Rebrickable database is explored.
